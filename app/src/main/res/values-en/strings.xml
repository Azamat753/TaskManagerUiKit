    <string name="advice2">\"Get into the habit of keeping records of income and expenses electronically or in writing.\"</string>
    <string name="advice3_1">Get rid of credit cards, consumer loans, and other debt.</string>
    <string name="advice3_2">\" Debt is a psychological burden, putting people under stress and making them worry about the future. As a result, you will pay for using other people\'s money not only with your own money, but also with your health and energy.\"</string>
    <string name="advice4_1">Live within your means.</string>
    <string name="advice4_2">\" When you break this rule, you lose the harmony in your own life. You are spending money that you have not earned, In fact, using what does not belong to you, you can lose it at any time!

    <string name="advice12_2">\" Regularly pulling money out of your wallet, but not bringing the old pleasure. We spend money to get some emotions. At the same price, different things can bring different amounts of emotions. For example, coffee in a cafe for 200 rubles, which you used to drink after lunch, no longer causes delight and satisfaction, but still costs your budget 1000 rubles a week. For the same thousand, you could get a lot more emotions by going to a massage or a movie.\"</string>
    <string name="advice13_1">Feel free to ask for a discount and take advantage of special offers.</string>
    <string name="advice13_2">\" The seller will probably be more profitable to offer you a discount and sell the product than to refuse the discount and not sell anything.\"</string>

    <string name="advice18_1">Buy the necessary high-quality things.</string>
    <string name="advice18_2">\" High-quality products, as a rule, are more expensive, but it is cheaper to use.\"</string>
